# Superchat!

* Realtime chat over HTML5 Web Sockets
* Translate chat messages between English and Spanish on the fly
* Drag and drop to share files
* Upload your picture using your webcam with HTML5 getUserMedia (no Flash!)
* Call in to record or listen to chat messages in either English or Spanish

* Most definitely requires Chrome for the sweet, sweet goodness
* Calling in to the phone number requires the server to be running on my AWS instance - give me a shout and I can turn it on
